## Quick Start with Placeholder Sounds

If you want to test the system before finding perfect sounds, you can:

1. Use AI sound generators:
   - [ElevenLabs Sound Effects](https://elevenlabs.io/sound-effects)
   - Describe the sound you want (e.g., "AK-47 gunshot")

2. Use text-to-speech for testing:
   - Temporary placeholder sounds just to test the system

3. Record your own sounds:
   - Use a smartphone and make mouth sounds (classic game dev technique!)

---

## Installation Steps

1. **Create the directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/assets/sounds/cs
   ```

2. **Download your chosen sounds** from the sources above

3. **Rename files** to match the required filenames:
   - `ak47.mp3`, `deagle.mp3`, etc.

4. **Place files** in `public/assets/sounds/cs/`

5. **Verify file structure:**
   ```bash
   ls -la public/assets/sounds/cs/
   ```

   You should see all 29 sound files listed.

6. **Test in game** - The sounds will automatically load when you start the game!

## Sound Specifications

For best results, ensure your sounds meet these specs:

- **Format:** MP3 (widely supported)
- **Sample Rate:** 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz
- **Bit Rate:** 128-192 kbps (good quality, small size)
- **Channels:** Mono or Stereo
- **Duration:**
  - Gunshots: 0.1-0.5 seconds
  - Reloads: 1-2 seconds
  - Footsteps: 0.2-0.4 seconds
  - Shell drops: 0.3-0.6 seconds

---

## Converting Audio Files

If you download WAV files, convert to MP3 using:

### Online Converters:
- [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/wav-to-mp3)
- [Online-Convert](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-mp3)

### Command Line (FFmpeg):
```bash
# Install ffmpeg first (Mac)
brew install ffmpeg

# Convert single file
ffmpeg -i input.wav -b:a 192k output.mp3

# Batch convert all WAV files in a folder
for f in *.wav; do ffmpeg -i "$f" -b:a 192k "${f%.wav}.mp3"; done
```

---

## Fallback Behavior

The sound system includes fallback sounds:

- If CS sounds aren't found, it uses the existing `Fire 1-5.mp3` sounds
- The game will still work even if some sounds are missing
- Check browser console for warnings about missing sounds

---

## Attribution (if required)

If you use CC-BY licensed sounds, add credits to your game:

Create a `CREDITS.md` file:

```markdown
# Sound Credits

## Weapon Sounds
- AK-47 sound by [Author] from Freesound.org (CC-BY 4.0)
- AWP sound by [Author] from Zapsplat.com

## Footstep Sounds
- Footsteps by [Author] from OpenGameArt.org (CC-BY 3.0)

[Add all attribution as required by licenses]
```

---

## Testing Your Sounds

After installation, test each sound type:

1. **Weapon sounds** - Fire different weapons (pistol, rifle, SMG, shotgun)
2. **Footsteps** - Move your character around
3. **Hit sounds** - Get hit by enemies (body shots, headshots)
4. **Death sound** - Die in game
5. **Shell drops** - Listen after firing (subtle sound)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Sounds not playing?**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify file paths match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- Ensure files are MP3 format
- Check file permissions (readable)

**Sounds too loud/quiet?**
- Adjust volumes in `sound-effects.js` (lines 76-132)
- Change the volume parameter in `soundManager.preload()`

**Performance issues?**
- Reduce pool sizes in preload calls
- Compress audio files to lower bitrate
- Use mono instead of stereo

---

## Next Steps

Once sounds are installed, you can:

1. Fine-tune volumes in `sound-effects.js`
2. Adjust distance attenuation for spatial audio
3. Add more weapon types with unique sounds
4. Implement reload mechanics with reload sounds
5. Add radio commands / voice lines

---

## Legal Note

**IMPORTANT:** Do not use copyrighted sounds from actual Counter-Strike game files.
Only use:
- Public domain (CC0) sounds
- Creative Commons licensed sounds (with attribution)
- Royalty-free sound packs
- Your own recordings

Using official CS:GO sounds without permission violates Valve's copyright.
